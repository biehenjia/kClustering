# kClustering
A list of various clustering algorithms built from scratch. 
# kMeans
kMeans clustering is a machine learning algorithm that aims to minimize the following expression, where $k$ is the number of clusters, $c_{i}$ represents each cluster, and $C_i$ represents the centroid representing cluster $c_{i}$
```math
$$\sum\limits^k_{i=1}\sum\limits^{|c_{i}|}_{j=1}|c_{i}[j]-C_{i}|^{2}$$
```
